# StudentPerformancePrediction-ML
This is a simple machine learning project that uses various classifiers to predict the factors affecting student grades, based on data from a CSV file.

The dataset includes students from different nationalities and grade levels, along with key factors such as the number of hands raised, number of attendances, hours studied, etc.

Multiple classifiers and ML models have been applied to identify which factors most accurately influence studentsâ€™ marks.

Additionally, visual aids like graphs and confusion matrices have been included to clearly present the results.
